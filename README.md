# Swift-SRWebClient

Note: This fork was updated to work with Swift 2.1.1

A super simple http client framework for iOS and OSX in Swift. 

## Features

1. Success and Failure closure blocks for easy callbacks.

2. NSOperationQueue and NSBlockOperation to execute web requests, using which we can have a elegant way to set queuePriority, threadPriority, qualityOfService and cancel any particular Operation or all the Operations in OperationQueue.

3. Provides function to send Image/`multipart/form-data` data.

4. Function chaining provides us to chain methods and provides more expressive code to make web requests.

5. Json deserialize, when any response is a valid JSON object, otherwise return the actaul response data as string.

6. Headers, Timeout Interval can be set and controlled for each request.

7. Test cases for all the functionalities

### Success and Failure Closures

```swift
SRWebClient.GET("http://headers.jsontest.com/", 
	success:{(response:AnyObject!, status:Int) -> Void in 
		//process success response
	}, failure:{(error:NSError!) -> Void in 
		//process failure response
	})
```

### NSBlockOperation

```swift
var webClient = SRWebClient(method: "POST", url:"http://validate.jsontest.com/")
webClient.timeoutInterval = 30.0
webClient.priority = NSOperationQueuePriority.High
webClient.send({(response:AnyObject!, status:Int) -> Void in
		//process success response
	}, failure:{(error:NSError!) -> Void in
        //process failure response        
	})
```

### Image Upload

```swift
var image:UIImage = UIImage(named: "apple.jpeg")
let imageData:NSData = NSData.dataWithData(UIImageJPEGRepresentation(image, 1.0))
SRWebClient.POST("http://www.tiikoni.com/tis/upload/upload.php")
	.data(imageData, fieldName:"file", data:["days":"1","title":"Swift-SRWebClient","caption":"Uploaded via Swift-SRWebClient (https://github.com/sraj/Swift-SRWebClient)"])
	.send({(response:AnyObject!, status:Int) -> Void in
		//process success response
	},failure:{(error:NSError!) -> Void in
		//process failure response
	})
```

### Function chaining

```swift
SRWebClient.POST("http://validate.jsontest.com")
	.headers(["Content-Type":"application/x-www-form-urlencoded charset=utf-8"])
	.data(["json":"[1, 2, 3]"])
	.send({(response:AnyObject!, status:Int) -> Void in
        	//process success response	        
		}, failure:{(error:NSError!) -> Void in
        	//process failure response    
		})
```

### JSON Deserialize

```swift
SRWebClient.GET("http://headers.jsontest.com/", 
	success:{(response:AnyObject!, status:Int) -> Void in 
		let headersJSON = response! as Dictionary<String, String>
		println(headersJSON["key"]!)
	}, failure:{(error:NSError!) -> Void in 
		println(error!.code)
	})
```

### Timeout Interval

```swift
var webClient = SRWebClient(method: "POST", url:"http://validate.jsontest.com/")
webClient.timeoutInterval = 60.0
webClient.headers(["key":"value"])
	.send({(response:AnyObject!, status:Int) -> Void in
        //process success response
	}, failure:{(error:NSError!) -> Void in
        //process failure response
	})
```

## TODO

- Retry mechanisam when a request fails.
- Provide a more elegant way to cancel/suspend each operation.
- Image download
- Any features requested.

Contribution welcome!
